`linkbank` is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) tool that creates linking ids for financial institutions in Central Credit Register (CRC) for the purpose of merging with Bank Balance Sheet (BBS) or Historical Series of the Portuguese Banking Sector (SLB). This command replaces older ones like mergebbs, mergecrc, and mergecrcslb. It requires a .dta file containing the updated merge instructions.
