# IREEPANEL: Creates a panel data set of the Fast and Exceptional Enterprise Survey - COVID-19 (COVID-IREE).

`ireepanel` is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) tool that constructs a panel data set of the Fast and Exceptional Enterprise Survey - COVID-19 (COVID-IREE) by appending the data files for each survey's edition. The command only works for the original anonymized data sets of the Fast and Exceptional Enterprise Survey - COVID-19 made available by BPLIM (IREE_A_WFRM_wwyyyy_eeee_V01.dta).

Please notice that the data comparability is affected by the change in the reference period (it is a week between Edition 152020 and Edition 182020, a fortnight from Edition 192020 to Edition 232020 and in Edition 012021, and a month in Edition 242020) and by the reformulation of some questions over time as detailed in the data manual.
