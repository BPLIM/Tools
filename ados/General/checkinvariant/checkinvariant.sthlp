{title:Description}

{pstd}This command checks whether a given variable is constant or varies within the unique values of another group of variables. It is useful to ensure that panel datasets are coherent (e.g. attributes that should be constant within unit or time period indeed are).

{pstd}The command also returns scalars and macros with the number and lists of variant and invariant variables that can be used in subsequent commands.

{pstd}The only dependency of this command is gtools, by Mauricio Caceres, about which you can find at {browse "https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools"}.

{pstd}In the repository where the {cmd:checkinvariant} is maintained, you can find a file with tests for the command that should verify that it is working properly. This can be particularly useful if you intend to make extensions to the command.
