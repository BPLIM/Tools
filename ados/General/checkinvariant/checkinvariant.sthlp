{title:Description}

{pstd}This command checks whether a given variable is constant or varies within the unique values of another group of variables. It is useful to ensure that panel datasets are coherent (e.g. attributes that should be constant within unit or time period indeed are).

{pstd}The only dependency of this command is gtools, by Mauricio Caceres, about which you can find at {browse "https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools"}.
