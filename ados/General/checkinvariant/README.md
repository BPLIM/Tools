# CHECKINVARIANT: Check if a variable is invariant within a group

This command checks whether a given variable is constant or varies within the unique values of another group of variables. It is useful to ensure that panel datasets are coherent (e.g. attributes that should be constant within unit or time period indeed are).

## Installation:

To install run the following in Stata:

net install checkinvariant, from("https://github.com/BPLIM/Tools/raw/master/ados/General/checkinvariant")
