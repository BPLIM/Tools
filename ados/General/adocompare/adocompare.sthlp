{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd: adocompare} is a Stata command that compares versions of ados found in 
two paths/files. In case a text file is specified as input (in options {opt first} 
and/or {opt second}), the extension of the file should be explicit in its name. 
Furthermore, this file should be produced with command {cmd: adoversion}. The user 
may also specify codewords for special paths defined by Stata and returned by 
command {help adopath:adopath}, such as {bf:BASE}, {bf:PLUS}, {bf:PERSONAL} and 
{bf:SITE}. It is also possible to use {bf:CWD} as a short name for the current 
working directory. 

{pstd}
The command produces an Excel report detailing the differences in ados and its versions 
in the input paths/files. The file has a summary sheet that outlines the main differences, namely ados found in only one of the two paths/files, ados found in both 
inputs but with different versions and ados with the same version. An additional sheet is produced for each of those cases, listing ados as well as their version. The exception is the sheet with information about ados found in both inputs with the same 
version, which is only created if the user specifies option {opt all}.  

{pstd}
In case the input is a path, please note that, in order to get the version of the ado, following Stata convention as well as the command {cmd: adoversion}, only lines that start with "*!" are parsed. Moreover, the command assumes 
{bf:[0-9][0-9]?\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?} as the pattern for 
the version of ado files. 


{title:Examples}

{pstd}
Example 1:
Compare ados and versions found in path "c:/data/ado/plus" and 
file "ado_plus.txt". Write report to "adocompare.xlsx".

{p 8 16}{inp:. adocompare, f("c:/data/ado/plus") s(ado_plus.txt)}{p_end}

{pstd}
Example 2:
Compare ados and versions found in path "c:/data/ado/personal" and 
file "ado_personal.txt". Write report to "compare.xlsx", replacing the 
file if it exists.

{p 8 16}{inp:. adocompare, f("c:/data/ado/personal") s(ado_personal.txt) save(compare, replace)}{p_end}

{pstd}
Example 3:
Compare ados and versions found in path "c:/data/ado/plus" and 
file "ado_plus.txt". Write report to "adocompare.xlsx" and include 
sheet with ados tha have the same version.

{p 8 16}{inp:. adocompare, f("c:/data/ado/plus") s(ado_plus.txt) all}{p_end}
