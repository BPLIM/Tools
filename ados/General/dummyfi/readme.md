# DUMMYFI: tool to generate random data

`dummyfi` creates a do-file that generates random data using a metadata file 
(see [mdata](https://github.com/BPLIM/Tools/tree/master/ados/General/mdata)) and a file 
with sampled ids provided by the user. The idea is to create a random data set that preserves the (time) structure and metadata of the original data set.

## Installation:

To install run the following in Stata:

```
net install dummyfi, from("https://github.com/BPLIM/Tools/raw/master/ados/General/dummyfi/")
```
