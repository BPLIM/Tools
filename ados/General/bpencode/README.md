# BPENCODE: Encode into numeric using a variable or an Excel file

`bpencode` is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) package that allows users to encode a variable using other variable or an Excel file. Unlike [encode](https://www.stata.com/manuals/dencode.pdf), it's possible to use this command with a numeric variable in order to label its values.

## Installation:

To install run the following in Stata:

net install bpencode, from("https://github.com/BPLIM/Tools/raw/master/ados/General/bpencode")
