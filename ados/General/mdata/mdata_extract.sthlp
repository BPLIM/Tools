{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt mdata extract} is a Stata command that exports metadata from data in memory
to an Excel file. This file is organized in sheets. 

{pstd}
The three first sheets are always exported, independently of the data set in memory.
The sheet {opt data_features_gen} contains general information about the 
data set, namely file name, data label, variables used to sort the data, label 
languages defined, notes and characteristics. The second sheet, {opt data_features_spec}, 
displays information on number of observations, number of variables, data set size, 
data singature and date of last change. A third sheet named {opt variables} presents 
a table with information for each variable, namely variable name, label (for every
defined language), value labels (if they exist), type, format, notes and characteristics.

{pstd}
If the data set has characteristics, notes or value labels defined, then there will 
be an additional sheet for each of them. There is one sheet per value label, note and 
characteristic. For value labels, the name of the sheet is {opt vl}_{it:name}, where {it:name}
is the name of the value label. For notes and characteristics, the name of the sheet is
{opt char/note}_{it:var}, where {it:var} is the name of the variable to which the note or 
characteristic applies.
