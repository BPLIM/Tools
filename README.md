# Tools

In this folder, we provide all packages created and maintained by the BPLIM team. While many of these tools are specific to BPLIM data sets and can only be used in BPLIM servers, they are made available to all to ensure transparency regarding their coding and versioning. Users are also welcome to suggest improvements or add their own contributions. 

The *ados* folder contains Stata *ado* files. Withn the *ados/general* subfolder, you can find general purpose tools that can be used outside of BPLIM servers. Please note that we do not provide any warranty regarding the use of these tools.
