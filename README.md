# Tools

In this folder we make available all tools that are created and maintained by the BPLIM team. While many of these tools are specific to 
BPLIM data sets and thus can only be used in BPLIM servers they are made available to the community so that we can be transparent about 
their coding and versioning. Users are also welcome to suggest improvements or add their own contributions. 
The *ados* folder contains Stata *ado* files. In the *general* folder (withib the *ados* folder) you can find general purpose tools that can be used outside of BPLIM servers. Please note that we do not provide a warranty of any kind regarding the use of these tools.
